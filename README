RED vs GOLD

I'm playing around with GameMaker Studio. The game's theme is the battle between Trainers Red and Gold from the Pokemon video game series.

2/1/2018
	Made sprites for Red and Gold.
	Made a background of Mt. Silver.
	Added a mist effect. It slides across the screen, but I haven't figured out yet how to loop it/make it endless.

	Gold can move left and right with keyboard commands. He collides with Red and with the left edge of Mt. Silver.
	If the player presses "Z" when Red is next to Gold, a textbox appears. The player can make the textbox disappear by pressing "Z" again.

2/2/2018
	Added Up/Down animation for Gold.
	Gold can run by pressing “X”.

	Can trigger text box with Red by pressing “Z” without pressing arrow key.
	Gold is locked from moving while text box is triggered.

	Mist effect moves back and forth.

	Added textbox for debugging.

2/5/2018
	Text now plays three characters at a time instead of all at once.
	Multiple pages of text.

	Gold can no longer move while in up/down animation.
	
	Added “wind” sound.
	Added button sounds when pressing through text.
	Added battle music that plays after text is finished.

	Added storm animation that plays after text is finished.

2/5/2018
	Added an epic battle transition animation.
	Utilizing screen shakes and fade outs.

2/7/2018
	Added a stadium room that Gold can walk around freely in.
	Made sprites for Pokemon.
	However, having reached the limits of the free trial version of GameMaker Studio, I have decided to finish the rest of this project with Unity.
